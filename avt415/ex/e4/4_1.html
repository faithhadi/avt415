		<h3>Best Practices for The Mobile-First Approach</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>1. Prioritize Page Content </dt>
		<dd>When it comes to mobile-first design, designers must bear in mind the fact that content is the key. As there are space restrictions on smaller screens, web designers must ensure that the most critical elements are prominently displayed since those are the ones users will actively look for. </dd>
			
		<dt>2. Deliver Intuitive Navigation</dt>
		<dd>Intuitive navigation is of utmost importance when it comes to delivering a neat and clean user experience on mobile devices. Web designers can leverage features like navigation drawers (using Hamburger menus) to display secondary elements of the website. This will help users to find the necessary information easily. </dd>
			
		<dt>3. Avoid Disruptive Pop-ups </dt>
		<dd>As mentioned frequently, mobile devices have space constraints and no user likes to be accosted with sudden pop-ups or advertisements taking over the screen. Website owners or designers must only focus on whatâ€™s important for users and provide them with the things they are looking for in the first place. </dd>
			
		<dt>4. Test on Real Devices Under Real Conditions</dt>
		<dd>The most effective way of ensuring that a website delivers optimal user experiences across devices is by testing them on real devices. This helps designers verify whether the website renders as expected across mobiles, tablets, and desktops. </dd>
